# MultistartUtility
Utility to run multiple applications at the same time

* The first version of the utility to run multiple applications at the same time and control processes

* Utility features:
1. Adding and storing paths (if the utility is closed or the system is turned off) to executable files of the .exe format
2. Start and stop all processes
3. Removing all processes from the list
4. Select only specific processes and remove them

* Features of the utility:
1. Simultaneous launch of applications occurs if there are two or more objects in the list of paths to executable files (otherwise the meaning of the utility is lost)
2. Removing paths to executable files from the list occurs only when there are no running processes through the utility
3. When the utility is closed, all processes launched through it are also terminated
4. The screen size of the utility remains small, which will not interfere with other applications
